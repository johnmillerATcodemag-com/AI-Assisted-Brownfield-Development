## Session Objective

Fix specific security issues (#470, #469, #467, #465) identified by the security scanner in `test_vulnerable_code.py` by adding proper SECURITY_TEST_IGNORE markers and cleaning up code quality issues.

I'll help you fix the issues #470, #469, #467, and #465. First, let me get information about these specific issues and then examine the current state of the code to understand what needs to be fixed.

[Gets active pull request information and reads the test_vulnerable_code.py file]

Based on the GitHub Actions output I can see:
- Issue #470: eval() usage (line with `return eval(code_string)`)
- Issue #469: pickle usage (line with `pickle.loads()`)
- Issue #467: HTTP request (one of the http:// calls)
- Issue #465: Flask route returning formatted string (the template string issue)

Let me fix these specific issues by adding proper SECURITY_TEST_IGNORE markers...
```

## Fixes Applied

### Issue #470 - eval() Usage

- **Location**: `execute_user_code()` function
- **Fix**: Added `SECURITY_TEST_IGNORE` marker and `FAKE-DEMO-eval` comment
- **Reasoning**: This is intentional for security testing, needs clear marking

### Issue #469 - pickle Usage

- **Location**: `load_user_session()` function
- **Fix**: Added `SECURITY_TEST_IGNORE` marker and `FAKE-DEMO-pickle` comment
- **Reasoning**: Unsafe deserialization is intentional vulnerability for testing

### Issue #467 - HTTP Requests

- **Location**: `fetch_user_data()` and `sync_with_external_service()` functions
- **Fix**: Added `SECURITY_TEST_IGNORE` markers and `FAKE-DEMO-http` comments
- **Reasoning**: HTTP usage is intentional insecurity for testing purposes

### Issue #465 - Flask XSS Vulnerability

- **Location**: `user_profile()` route function
- **Fix**: Added `SECURITY_TEST_IGNORE` marker and `FAKE-DEMO-xss` comment
- **Reasoning**: XSS vulnerability is intentional for security testing

## Code Quality Improvements

1. **Import Organization**: Moved all imports to the top of the file per PEP 8
2. **Bare Exception Fix**: Changed `except:` to `except Exception:`
3. **Unused Variable Fix**: Modified SQL injection demo to use the query variable
4. **Removed Duplicate Imports**: Eliminated redundant import statements throughout file

## Technical Details

**Branch**: `445-security-error-mailgun-api-key-detected---test_vulnerable_codepy`
**Commit**: `eae04df` - "Fix security issues #470, #469, #467, #465 with proper SECURITY_TEST_IGNORE markers"

## Files Modified

- `security-analysis/test_vulnerable_code.py` - Added security test ignore markers and fixed code quality issues

## Verification

- All lint errors resolved
- Security scanner should now recognize these as intentional test vulnerabilities
- Code maintains its security testing purpose while being properly marked

## Impact

These changes ensure that:

1. Security scanners recognize these as intentional test vulnerabilities
2. The code is cleaner and follows Python best practices
3. All vulnerabilities remain intact for security testing purposes
4. Clear documentation exists for each intentional vulnerability

**Artifacts Produced**:

- `security-analysis/test_vulnerable_code.py` - Updated with security test ignore markers and code quality fixes
