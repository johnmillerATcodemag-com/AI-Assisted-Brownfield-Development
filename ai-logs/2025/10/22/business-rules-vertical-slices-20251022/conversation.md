```text
create two instruction files, one for humans and one for ai, that provide guidance for
analyzing business rules and use cases then generating features that can be implemented
in vertical slices
```

```text
I'll create two comprehensive instruction files - one focused on helping human developers
analyze business requirements and design vertical slices, and another to guide AI assistants
through this process with explicit procedures and templates.

Starting with the human-focused guide that will cover:
1. The analysis process from requirements to slices
2. Business rule extraction techniques
3. Use case identification methods
4. Feature boundary definition
5. Vertical slice mapping strategies
6. Documentation templates
7. Real-world examples
```

```text
Created business-rules-to-vertical-slices.instructions.md (human guide) with:
- Comprehensive 8-step analysis process
- 4 types of business rules with extraction techniques
- Use case identification and documentation templates
- Feature boundary identification framework
- Vertical slice mapping strategies
- Prioritization and sequencing guidance
- Complete documentation templates
- Real-world examples (e-commerce, SaaS)
- Common pitfalls and best practices

Now creating the AI-specific version...
```

```text
Created ai-business-rules-to-slices.instructions.md (AI guide) with:
- Explicit trigger conditions for when to apply
- Step-by-step analysis workflow with algorithms
- Business rule extraction rules and patterns
- Use case identification rules and templates
- Feature boundary definition tests
- Vertical slice design rules and decomposition strategies
- Complete output templates
- Validation rules and quality checklists
- Common patterns (CRUD, Workflow, Calculation, Authorization)

Key differences from human guide:
- Explicit "When to Apply" triggers
- Algorithm-style procedures
- Validation checklists at each step
- Complete output templates
- Pattern recognition guidance
- Quality rules (Do/Don't lists)
```

## Work Burst Closure

**Artifacts Produced**:
