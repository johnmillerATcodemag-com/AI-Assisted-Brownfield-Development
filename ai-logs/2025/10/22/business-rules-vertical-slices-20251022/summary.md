# Session Summary: Business Rules to Vertical Slices Instruction Creation

**Session ID**: business-rules-vertical-slices-20251022
**Date**: 2025-10-22
**Operator**: johnmillerATcodemag-com
**Model**: anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet@2024-10-22
**Duration**: 01:00:00

## Objective

Create comprehensive instruction files (one for human developers, one for AI assistants) that provide guidance for analyzing business rules and use cases, then generating features that can be implemented as vertical slices.

## Work Completed

### Primary Deliverables

1. **Business Rules to Vertical Slices (Human Guide)** (`.github/instructions/business-rules-to-vertical-slices.instructions.md`)

   - Comprehensive analysis process (8 steps)
   - Business rule extraction techniques (4 types)
   - Use case identification methods
   - Feature boundary identification framework
   - Vertical slice mapping strategies
   - Prioritization and sequencing guidance
   - Documentation templates
   - Real-world examples (e-commerce, SaaS)
   - Common pitfalls and best practices
   - ~1000+ lines

2. **AI Business Rules to Slices (AI Guide)** (`.github/instructions/ai-business-rules-to-slices.instructions.md`)
   - Explicit trigger conditions
   - Step-by-step analysis workflow
   - Business rule extraction rules with algorithms
   - Use case identification procedures
   - Feature boundary definition tests
   - Vertical slice design rules
   - Complete output templates
   - Validation rules and checklists
   - Common patterns (CRUD, Workflow, Calculation, Authorization)
   - ~800+ lines

### Secondary Work

- Created conversation log documenting the creation process
- Created summary documenting objectives, work, and decisions
- Prepared AI provenance metadata for both files

## Key Decisions

### Different Approaches for Different Audiences

**Decision**: Create distinct instruction files for humans and AI rather than a single generic guide

**Rationale**:

- Human developers need understanding of WHY (principles, rationale, context)
- AI assistants need explicit HOW (algorithms, templates, validation rules)
- Previous experience with vertical-slice-architecture.instructions.md vs ai-vertical-slice-implementation.instructions.md validated this approach
- Humans benefit from examples and narrative explanations
- AI benefits from structured procedures and checklists

### Comprehensive Template Coverage

**Decision**: Include complete templates for every analysis artifact (rules, use cases, features, slices)

**Rationale**:

- Templates ensure consistency
- AI can directly use templates in output
- Humans can adapt templates to their needs
- Templates capture all required information
- Reduces ambiguity in what to document

### Algorithm-Style Procedures for AI

**Decision**: Express AI instructions as pseudocode algorithms and step-by-step procedures

**Rationale**:

- AI models excel at following structured procedures
- Algorithms are unambiguous
- Step-by-step reduces errors
- Easier to validate AI followed instructions
- Consistent with existing AI instruction patterns in repository

### Four Types of Business Rules

**Decision**: Categorize business rules into 4 types: Structural, Operative, Derivation, Action Enablers

**Rationale**:

- Industry-standard categorization
- Each type has different implications for implementation
- Clear extraction patterns for each type
- Helps identify what might be missing
- Aligns with common business analysis practices

### Pattern Recognition for AI

**Decision**: Include common patterns section (CRUD, Workflow, Calculation, Authorization) in AI guide

**Rationale**:

- Many business requirements follow predictable patterns
- AI can recognize patterns and apply standard approaches
- Reduces analysis time for common scenarios
- Improves consistency across similar features
- Provides starting point that can be customized

## Artifacts Produced

| Artifact                                                                     | Type        | Purpose                                                     |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `.github/instructions/business-rules-to-vertical-slices.instructions.md`     | Instruction | Human guide for business analysis to vertical slice design  |
| `.github/instructions/ai-business-rules-to-slices.instructions.md`           | Instruction | AI assistant guide for analyzing requirements and designing |
| `ai-logs/2025/10/22/business-rules-vertical-slices-20251022/conversation.md` | Log         | Full conversation transcript                                |
| `ai-logs/2025/10/22/business-rules-vertical-slices-20251022/summary.md`      | Summary     | Session summary and resumability context                    |

## Lessons Learned

1. **Audience Matters**: The same content structured differently for humans vs AI significantly improves usability

2. **Templates Drive Quality**: Comprehensive templates ensure nothing is missed and improve consistency

3. **Validation Checklists**: Pre- and post-analysis checklists prevent common mistakes

4. **Real-World Examples**: Concrete examples (e-commerce, SaaS) make abstract concepts tangible

5. **Pattern Recognition**: Identifying common patterns (CRUD, workflows) accelerates analysis

## Next Steps

### Immediate

- Update README.md with links to new instruction files
- Verify all AI provenance metadata is complete in both files
- Test instructions with sample business requirements

### Future Enhancements

- Add more real-world examples across different domains
- Create video walkthrough of analysis process
- Develop validation tools to check analysis completeness
- Add more common patterns as they emerge
- Create quick reference cards for developers

## Compliance Status

✅ Both files include complete AI provenance metadata (11 required fields)
✅ Conversation log created with all exchanges
✅ Summary created with resumability context
✅ Files follow repository naming conventions
✅ Proper YAML frontmatter with applyTo patterns
⏳ README.md update pending
⏳ Quality validation pending
