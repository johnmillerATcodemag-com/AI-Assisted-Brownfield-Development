```text
I'll create a comprehensive instruction file that provides guidance for creating new instruction files in the repository. This will cover the complete process from planning to validation, including all AI provenance requirements and quality standards.

The instruction file will include:
- When to create instruction files
- File structure requirements (metadata, content)
- Content guidelines for different audiences
- Creation process options (meta-prompt, manual, copy-adapt)
- Quality standards and validation
- Common patterns and examples
- Integration requirements
- Maintenance guidance

Creating the file now with complete AI provenance metadata and following all repository standards.
```
