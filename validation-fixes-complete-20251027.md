## Issues Resolved

### âœ… Issue #4: Terminology Inconsistency (LOW PRIORITY)

**Problem**: Inconsistent use of "chat session" vs "chat" terminology

**Fix Applied**:
- Updated `.github/instructions/copilot-instructions.md`:
  - Changed "chat session" â†’ "chat" (3 occurrences)
  - Changed "sessions" â†’ "chats" in rationale
- Updated `.github/instructions/ai/ai-assisted-output.instructions.md`:
  - Changed "chat session" â†’ "chat" (2 occurrences)
  - Changed "session" â†’ "chat" in objective and summary contexts (4 occurrences)
  - Updated "Session Metadata" â†’ "Chat Metadata"
  - Changed `session_id` â†’ `chat_id` in metadata template

**Verification**:
```bash
# No more "chat session" references
grep "chat session" .github/instructions/*.md
# Returns: (no results)
```

**Commit**: a8fc041 "Fix Issue #4: Replace 'chat session' with 'chat' for terminology consistency"

### âœ… Issue #3: Duplication of AI Provenance Requirements (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Problem**: AI provenance metadata requirements duplicated across 3 files

**Original State**:
- `ai-assisted-output.instructions.md`: Lines 87-108 (full specification)
- `copilot-instructions.md`: Lines 137-176 (complete duplication)
- `instruction-prompt.instructions.md`: Referenced canonical but showed template

**Fix Applied**:

1. **Marked Canonical Source** in `ai-assisted-output.instructions.md`:
   - Added ðŸ”’ CANONICAL SOURCE marker to "Required provenance metadata" section
   - Clearly identified as single source of truth

2. **Refactored copilot-instructions.md**:
   - Removed full duplication of all 11 required fields
   - Added reference link to canonical source
   - Kept Copilot-specific guidance:
     - Model field format requirements
     - Operator field (GitHub username)
     - Chat ID (Copilot-generated)
     - Source field value patterns
   - Reduced from ~40 lines to ~25 lines

3. **instruction-prompt.instructions.md**:
   - Already referenced canonical source (line 64)
   - Template kept as it's needed for prompt generation
   - No changes required

**Verification**:
```bash
# Canonical marker present
grep "CANONICAL SOURCE" .github/instructions/ai/ai-assisted-output.instructions.md
# Returns: 2 matches (provenance section + chat logging section)

# Copilot-instructions references canonical
grep "as defined in.*ai-assisted-output" .github/instructions/copilot-instructions.md
# Returns: Reference link found
```

**Benefits**:
- Single source of truth established
- Updates only needed in one place
- No risk of version skew
- Context-specific guidance preserved

**Commit**: 491bf65 "Fix Issues #3 and #6: Eliminate AI provenance and post-creation duplication"

### âœ… Issue #6: Duplication of Post-Creation Requirements (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Problem**: Post-creation workflow documentation duplicated across files

**Original State**:
- `ai-assisted-output.instructions.md`: AI chat logging workflow (canonical but unmarked)
- `copilot-instructions.md`: Lines 178-225 (full duplication)
- `prompt-file.instructions.md`: Lines 1631-1696 (full duplication)

**Fix Applied**:

1. **Marked Canonical Source** in `ai-assisted-output.instructions.md`:
   - Added ðŸ”’ CANONICAL SOURCE marker to "AI chat logging workflow" section
   - Clearly identified as single source of truth

2. **Refactored copilot-instructions.md**:
   - Removed full duplication of 3-step post-creation process
   - Added reference link to canonical workflow
   - Kept Copilot-specific automation notes:
     - Auto-update conversation log
     - Auto-generate/update summary
     - Prompt for README update
   - Added quick reference examples
   - Reduced from ~48 lines to ~25 lines

3. **Refactored prompt-file.instructions.md**:
   - Removed full duplication of post-creation steps
   - Added reference link to canonical workflow
   - Kept prompt-specific requirements:
     - Conversation log artifact entry format
     - README section categorization
     - Verification checklist
   - Reduced from ~66 lines to ~30 lines

**Verification**:
```bash
# Canonical marker present
grep "CANONICAL SOURCE.*chat logging" .github/instructions/ai/ai-assisted-output.instructions.md
# Returns: Match found

# References to canonical workflow
grep "follow the AI chat logging workflow as defined" .github/instructions/*.md
# Returns: 2 matches (copilot-instructions.md + prompt-file.instructions.md)
```

**Benefits**:
- Workflow defined in single location
- Context-specific automation notes preserved
- Maintenance burden eliminated
- Clear reference chain

**Commit**: 491bf65 "Fix Issues #3 and #6: Eliminate AI provenance and post-creation duplication"
