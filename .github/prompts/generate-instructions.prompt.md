# Generate Project Instruction Files

You are an expert software architect and documentation specialist. Your task is to analyze the current codebase and generate comprehensive instruction files following the GitHub Copilot Instruction File Format.

**IMPORTANT**: Only create NEW instruction files that do not already exist. Never modify or overwrite existing files.

## Analysis Phase

First, analyze the codebase to identify:

1. **Project Structure and Technologies**

   - Primary programming languages used
   - Frameworks and libraries detected
   - Architecture patterns observed
   - Database technologies
   - Cloud platforms (Azure, AWS, GCP)
   - Frontend technologies (React, Vue, Angular, etc.)
   - Backend technologies (.NET, Node.js, Python, Java, etc.)

2. **Existing Patterns and Conventions**

   - Naming conventions currently used
   - Code organization patterns
   - Error handling approaches
   - Testing strategies
   - Documentation styles

3. **Technology Stack Assessment**

```

### Quality Assurance Checklist for Each File

Before creating any instruction file, verify:

1. **No Content Duplication**: Content is unique and doesn't duplicate other files
2. **Clear References**: Appropriate cross-references to related files
3. **Version Consistency**: Technology versions reference project-instructions.md
4. **Scope Boundaries**: Content stays within the file's defined scope
5. **Integration Points**: Clear guidance on how this technology integrates with others

## Special Considerations

### For Multi-Technology Projects

#### Integration Focus Areas
- Create cross-technology integration instructions in the general project instructions
- Include API communication patterns between technologies in the general project instructions
- Document data flow between different technology layers in the general project instructions
- Define unified authentication and error handling strategies across all technologies

#### Content Separation Rules
- Keep technology-specific naming conventions, coding patterns, and framework details in their respective technology-specific instruction files
- **Never duplicate** naming conventions or coding standards between general and technology-specific files
- **Never duplicate** technology version information - maintain single source of truth in project-instructions.md
- **Never duplicate** testing framework details - reference technology-specific files from general testing strategy

#### Common Duplication Pitfalls to Avoid
1. **Technology Stack Definitions**: Only define in project-instructions.md, reference elsewhere
2. **Testing Coverage Standards**: Define once in testing-instructions.md, reference elsewhere
3. **Error Response Formats**: Define API standards in error-handling-instructions.md, not in technology-specific files
4. **File Organization**: Define high-level structure in style-instructions.md, specific naming in technology files
5. **Security Practices**: Define cross-technology patterns in practices-instructions.md, specific implementations in technology files

### For Microservices Architecture

- Create service-specific instruction folders
- Include inter-service communication guidelines
- Document deployment and orchestration patterns

### For Monolithic Architecture

- Create module-specific instructions
- Include layer separation guidelines
- Document internal API patterns

## Generation Rules

### Core Principles

1. **Analyze Before Generating**: Always analyze the codebase first to understand the actual technologies and patterns used
2. **Use Detected Patterns**: Base instruction content on actually observed patterns in the codebase
3. **Preserve Existing Files**: **NEVER modify or overwrite existing files** - only create new instruction files that don't already exist
4. **Practical Examples**: Use real examples from the codebase where possible

### Content Quality and Consistency

5. **Version Consistency**:
   - Create a centralized technology stack reference that all files can reference
   - Use specific version numbers consistently across all instruction files
   - Avoid generic version references when specific versions are available
   - Maintain a single source of truth for technology versions

6. **Avoid Duplication and Redundancy**:
   - Eliminate overlapping content between instruction files
   - Keep technology stack definitions in one authoritative location (project-instructions.md)
   - Reference other instruction files instead of duplicating content
   - Maintain clear content ownership boundaries between files

7. **Clear Hierarchical Structure**:
   - General instructions provide high-level architecture and integration guidance
   - Technology-specific instructions contain detailed implementation patterns
   - Establish precedence rules: technology-specific conventions override general ones
   - Create clear delegation patterns from general to specific files

8. **Cross-Referencing and Integration**:
   - Add explicit cross-references between related instruction files
   - Include "See also" sections linking to relevant files
   - Reference technology-specific files from general instructions
   - Create navigation aids for complex instruction hierarchies

### Content Organization

9. **Separation of Concerns**:
   - **General files**: Architecture, project structure, cross-technology integration, high-level best practices
   - **Technology-specific files**: Naming conventions, coding standards, framework patterns, detailed implementation guidance
   - **Avoid content bleed**: Don't duplicate technology-specific details in general files

10. **Naming Convention Clarity**:
    - Establish clear precedence rules for conflicting naming conventions
    - Document when technology-specific conventions override general ones
    - Provide conflict resolution guidance for edge cases
    - Maintain consistency within each technology domain

11. **Testing Strategy Coherence**:
    - Define clear boundaries between general testing philosophy and specific testing implementations
    - Avoid overlapping testing guidance between general and technology-specific files
    - Create unified testing coverage standards referenced by all files

### Quality Assurance

12. **Completeness**: Cover all major aspects of development for each detected technology
13. **Maintainability**: Structure instructions for easy updates and maintenance with minimal duplication
14. **Consistency**: Ensure all generated instructions follow the same format, style, and referencing patterns

## Output Format

After analysis, provide a comprehensive summary of:

### Analysis Results
1. **Detected Technologies and Versions**: Complete technology stack with specific version numbers
2. **Existing Instruction Analysis**: Assessment of current instruction files and identified quality issues
3. **Key Patterns and Conventions**: Observed coding patterns, naming conventions, and architectural decisions
4. **Quality Issues Identified**: Duplication, version inconsistencies, missing cross-references, and hierarchical problems

### Implementation Plan
5. **Proposed Instruction File Structure**: New files to be created (excluding existing files)
6. **Content Separation Strategy**: Clear boundaries between general and technology-specific content
7. **Cross-Reference Plan**: How new files will reference each other and existing files
8. **Version Consistency Strategy**: Plan for maintaining consistent technology versions

### Quality Assurance
9. **Conflict Resolution Approach**: How naming convention conflicts and precedence will be handled
10. **Redundancy Prevention**: Specific measures to avoid content duplication
11. **Maintenance Strategy**: How the instruction system will remain maintainable and consistent

Then proceed to generate only the NEW instruction files that don't already exist, using the established format, detected technologies, and quality improvement strategies.

## Safety Requirements

**CRITICAL**: Before creating any instruction file:

1. **Check if the file already exists** in the target location
2. **Skip creation** if a file with the same name already exists
3. **Only create new files** that don't conflict with existing ones
4. **Preserve all existing content** - never modify existing instruction files

## File Conflict Resolution and Quality Assurance

### Existing File Analysis

If instruction files already exist:

1. **Preservation First**: Never modify or overwrite existing files
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Analyze existing files to understand current patterns and conventions
3. **Consistency Alignment**: Use existing files as reference for format and style consistency
4. **Gap Analysis**: Only create supplementary files that fill genuine gaps
5. **Conflict Detection**: Document any detected inconsistencies but do not modify existing files

### Content Quality Assessment

Before creating new files, assess existing instruction quality for:

#### Duplication and Redundancy Issues
- **Technology Stack Definitions**: Check if versions are defined consistently across files
- **Testing Philosophy**: Identify overlapping testing guidance between general and specific files
- **Error Handling Patterns**: Look for redundant error handling information
- **File Organization**: Check for duplicated directory structure guidance
- **Build and Deployment**: Identify overlapping CI/CD and deployment guidance

#### Hierarchical Structure Issues
- **Precedence Rules**: Ensure clear precedence between general and technology-specific instructions
- **Content Boundaries**: Verify clear separation between general architecture and specific implementation
- **Cross-References**: Check for missing links between related instruction files
- **Navigation**: Assess ease of finding relevant guidance across multiple files

#### Version and Standard Consistency Issues
- **Technology Versions**: Identify inconsistent version references across files
- **Coverage Standards**: Check for conflicting test coverage targets
- **Naming Conventions**: Identify conflicts between general and technology-specific naming rules
- **Code Quality Metrics**: Verify consistent quality standards across all files

### Quality Improvement Strategy

When creating new files:

1. **Single Source of Truth**: Establish authoritative sources for commonly referenced information
2. **Clear Delegation**: General files should reference, not duplicate, technology-specific details
3. **Comprehensive Cross-Referencing**: Include "See Also" sections with relevant file references
4. **Conflict Resolution Rules**: Document precedence rules for conflicting conventions
5. **Version Centralization**: Maintain technology versions in a single authoritative location

### Content Separation Rules

#### General Instruction Files Should Contain:
- High-level architecture and integration patterns
- Cross-technology best practices and workflows
- Project structure and organization principles
- Integration patterns between different technologies
- Authoritative technology stack definitions and versions

#### Technology-Specific Files Should Contain:
- Detailed naming conventions and coding standards
- Framework-specific patterns and implementations
- Technology-specific testing frameworks and patterns
- Language-specific error handling and logging
- Platform-specific configuration and deployment details

#### Prohibited Content Duplication:
- **Never duplicate** technology versions between general and specific files
- **Never duplicate** naming conventions between general and technology-specific files
- **Never duplicate** detailed implementation patterns in general files
- **Never duplicate** testing framework specifics in general files
