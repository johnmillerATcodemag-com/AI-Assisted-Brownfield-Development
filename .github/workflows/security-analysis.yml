# DISABLED: Security Analysis Workflow
# This workflow has been temporarily disabled due to false positive issues
# being generated by security scanners that ignore exclusion configurations.
#
# Problem: Multiple scanners (Semgrep, Bandit, Custom) create 500+ false positives
# Solution: Workflow disabled until proper exclusion configuration implemented
#
# To re-enable: Remove this comment block and restore original triggers
