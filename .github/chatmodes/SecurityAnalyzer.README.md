## Automated GitHub Issue Creation

When security vulnerabilities are detected, the system automatically creates detailed GitHub issues with:

### Issue Structure

```markdown
## üîí Security Vulnerability Report

### Vulnerability Summary

**Severity**: [Critical/High/Medium/Low]
**CVSS Score**: [0.0-10.0]
**CWE ID**: [CWE-XXX]
**Component**: [Affected file/component]

### Description

[Detailed vulnerability description]

### Impact Assessment

[Business and technical impact analysis]

### Proof of Concept

[Code location and exploitation scenario]

### Remediation Steps

[Prioritized action items with timelines]

### Code Examples

[Vulnerable vs. secure implementations]

### Testing Recommendations

[Security testing guidance]

### References

[OWASP, CWE, and best practice links]
```

### Issue Labels

- `security` - All security-related issues
- `vulnerability` - Confirmed security vulnerabilities
- `[severity-level]` - critical, high, medium, low
- `[vulnerability-type]` - injection, xss, cryptography, authentication
- `[component]` - frontend, backend, infrastructure

## CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions Workflow

The security analysis system includes a comprehensive GitHub Actions workflow that:

1. **Runs multiple security scanners:**

   - Semgrep for SAST analysis
   - Custom pattern matching
   - Dependency vulnerability checking
   - Bandit for Python security issues

2. **Analyzes results and creates issues:**

   - Processes scan results
   - Deduplicates findings
   - Creates detailed GitHub issues
   - Adds security summary comments to PRs

3. **Provides security metrics:**
   - Vulnerability counts by severity
   - Security trends over time
   - Compliance status reporting

### Workflow Triggers

- **Push to main/develop branches**
- **Pull request creation/updates**
- **Weekly scheduled scans**
- **Manual workflow dispatch**

### Configuration

The workflow can be customized with these parameters:

```yaml
workflow_dispatch:
  inputs:
    scan_type:
      description: "Type of security scan to run"
      options: ["full", "critical-only", "dependencies-only", "owasp-top10"]

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Chat mode not responding
**Solution**: Ensure you're using the correct command format: `@SecurityAnalyzer @security-scan`

**Issue**: GitHub issues not being created
**Solution**: Check that the `GITHUB_TOKEN` has `issues: write` permissions

**Issue**: False positive detections
**Solution**: Review and customize security patterns in `.github/scripts/security_scanner.py`

**Issue**: Missing dependencies in workflow
**Solution**: Ensure all security tools are properly installed in the CI/CD environment

### Getting Help

- **Documentation**: Check this README and inline code comments
- **Issues**: Create a GitHub issue with the `question` label
- **Security Concerns**: Follow responsible disclosure practices

## Contributing

### Adding New Security Patterns

1. Edit `.github/scripts/security_scanner.py`
2. Add new patterns to the `patterns` dictionary
3. Include severity, CWE ID, and description
4. Test with sample code

### Improving Issue Templates

1. Edit `.github/scripts/create_security_issues.py`
2. Modify the issue body template

## Security Considerations

- **Private Repositories**: Ensure sensitive code isn't exposed in issue descriptions
- **Access Control**: Limit security scan results to authorized team members
- **Audit Trail**: Maintain logs of security scans and remediation activities
- **Compliance**: Ensure scanning practices meet regulatory requirements
