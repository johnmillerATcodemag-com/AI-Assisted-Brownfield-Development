## Canonical Issues Remaining Open

The following issues were kept as the canonical representatives:

| Issue # | Type | Severity | Description |
|---------|------|----------|-------------|
| **#452** | HTTP Security | MEDIUM | Insecure HTTP connection - test_vulnerable_code.py |
| **#456** | Crypto | LOW | Weak random number generator - test_vulnerable_code.py |
| **#458** | Secrets | ERROR | Mailgun API Key detected - test_vulnerable_code.py |
| **#460** | Crypto | WARNING | MD5 used as password hash - test_vulnerable_code.py |
| **#461** | Crypto | WARNING | SHA1 hash algorithm detected - test_vulnerable_code.py |
| **#463** | XSS | WARNING | Flask XSS vulnerability - test_vulnerable_code.py |

## Other Open Issues (Non-duplicates)

The following issues remain open as they are unique vulnerabilities:

| Issue # | Type | Severity | Description |
|---------|------|----------|-------------|
| **#447** | SQL Injection | HIGH | Potential SQL injection - security_scanner.py |
| **#448** | HTTP Security | MEDIUM | Insecure HTTP connection - security_scanner.py |
| **#449** | Secrets | HIGH | Hardcoded secret - test_security_analyzer.py |
| **#450** | Secrets | HIGH | Hardcoded secret - test_vulnerable_code.py |
| **#451** | Secrets | HIGH | Hardcoded secret - test_vulnerable_code.py |
| **#459** | SQL Injection | ERROR | SQL string concatenation - test_vulnerable_code.py |
| **#468** | Command Injection | ERROR | subprocess with shell=True - test_vulnerable_code.py |
| **#469** | Deserialization | WARNING | pickle usage - test_vulnerable_code.py |
| **#470** | Code Injection | WARNING | eval() usage - test_vulnerable_code.py |

## Cleanup Results

- ✅ **10 duplicate issues closed** successfully
- ✅ **15 unique issues remain** for actual security review
- ✅ **Clear documentation** provided for each closure
- ✅ **No information lost** - all closure reasons documented

## Issues Already Closed

Note: Issues #453, #466, and #471 were already closed when the script ran, indicating they may have been manually closed or closed by another process.

## Script Used

The cleanup was performed using the PowerShell script:
`scripts/close_duplicate_security_issues.ps1`

This script:
- Identified duplicates based on vulnerability type and file location
- Added explanatory comments to each closed issue
- Used GitHub CLI to systematically close duplicates
- Provided dry-run capability for safe preview

## Impact

**Before**: 25 security issues (many duplicates, difficult to prioritize)  
**After**: 15 unique security issues (clear, actionable list)

This cleanup makes it much easier to:
1. **Prioritize** actual security work
2. **Avoid duplicate effort** 
3. **Track progress** on unique vulnerabilities
4. **Plan remediation** more effectively

## Next Steps

1. **Review remaining 15 issues** for actual security impact
2. **Prioritize by severity**: CRITICAL/HIGH → MEDIUM → LOW → INFO
3. **Focus on production code** issues first (#447, #448 in security_scanner.py)
4. **Address test file issues** with proper SECURITY_TEST_IGNORE markers
